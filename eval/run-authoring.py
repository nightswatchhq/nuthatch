"""Run RFC-0017's authoring evaluation: can an agent build a working nest from nothing?

RFC-0016 §1 measures **runtime** knowledge - an agent with MCP tools querying a nest that already
exists. This measures **authoring** knowledge: the builder skill plus a shell, a contract address,
and nothing else. An agent with only MCP cannot scaffold a nest; an agent with only the skill cannot
say what a table means as of block N.

RFC-0017 fixes the three criteria and this file does not reinvent them: `init` succeeds, `dev`
reaches the pinned tip, one canned question answers correctly - "scored mechanically (exit codes +
result comparison)". Nothing here reads the agent's prose. Three facts about the filesystem and one
result set.

The board is proven before anyone plays on it: `tests/authoring_eval_board.rs` walks this same
scenario with a scripted reference solution and must be green in CI first. A 0/3 against an
unproven board is a number about nothing.

Fully offline: `scripts/fixture_rpc.py` serves the chain over loopback and the ABI is a local file.
