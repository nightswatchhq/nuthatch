# Reading Nuthatch segments without Nuthatch

The sealed directory is the escape hatch: plain Parquet, a JSON catalogue, no nuthatch process
required. This page is the contract for that, as the binary writes it today. A type change in
`src/seal.rs::rows_to_batch` that this page does not match is a broken contract, not a docs lag.

It is not a second catalogue format, and it is not a promise about files nuthatch has not yet
sealed. The hot tip lives in `nuthatch.redb` and is not Parquet; an external engine pointed at
this directory sees history through the last sealed block, not the unfinalised window.

RFC-0047 C1. FLBA32 (`FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY(32)`) is not what is written; that would be a format
version ([#1222](https://github.com/nightswatchhq/nuthatch/issues/1222)), not a write-down of
current behaviour.

## Directory layout

A solo nest (`nuthatch dev` in the nest directory) looks like this:

```
<dataset>/
  nuthatch.toml
  nuthatch.redb          # hot store; not this page
  segments/
    manifest.json        # the catalogue
    {table}-{hash}.parquet
```

The catalogue lives **inside** `segments/`, at `segments/manifest.json`. It is not a sibling of
that directory. nuthatch installs it by writing `segments/manifest.json.tmp`, fsyncing the bytes,
and renaming over the target, so a reader or a crash sees either the previous catalogue or the new
one, never a torn file (`src/seal.rs::save_manifest`).

When the dataset is a mount, it sits at `<runtime>/data/<nid>/`. The catalogue still lives on the
dataset, at `data/<nid>/segments/manifest.json`. The Parquet bytes live in a **shared store** at
the runtime root, keyed only by content address:

```
<runtime>/
  data/<nid>/
    segments/manifest.json
  segments/
    {hash}.parquet
```

The catalogue's `file` field is always `{table}-{hash}.parquet`, even when the bytes are in the
shared store as `{hash}.parquet`. Resolve a segment the way `src/seal.rs::segment_path` does:

1. If the dataset path is `<runtime>/data/<nid>` **and** `<runtime>/segments/{hash}.parquet`
   exists, that is the file.
2. Otherwise `<dataset>/segments/{file}`.

A dataset migrated before the shared store still reads from (2). A missing shared copy is not
corruption; it is a layout that has not been relocated yet.

**Do not glob.** A file not named by the catalogue is not a sealed segment. Globbing
`segments/*.parquet` misses the shared store, picks up strays, and skips the resolution rule
above. The catalogue is the source of truth; the files are what it points at.

A segment's `hash` is the lowercase hex sha256 of the **Parquet file bytes**. Those bytes include
the `created_by` string arrow-rs stamps, so the same rows sealed by two nuthatch versions built
on different arrow-rs releases may hash differently (F-D3). Same binary, identical bytes,
identical hash. Do not use a hash as a cross-version equality proof; compare decoded rows for
that. See [operators.md](operators.md#data-lifecycle).

Startup moves a per-dataset file that is missing, unreadable, or hash-mismatched into a sibling
`quarantine/` directory. It never moves a shared-store file (other mounts may still name it).
`quarantine/` is outside `segments/` and is not in the catalogue.

## Catalogue schema

`segments/manifest.json` is one JSON object, pretty-printed:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 1,
  "tables": {
    "usdc__transfer": [
      {
        "hash": "ab…",
        "from_block": 1,
        "to_block": 100,
        "rows": 20000,
        "file": "usdc__transfer-ab….parquet",
        "writer_profile": "zstd-bloom-v1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`manifest_version` sits on the object, not the segment. A catalogue written before it existed has
no such key and **is version 0**; treat an absent key as 0 rather than as unknown.

Per segment, today:

| field | required | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hash` | yes | sha256 of the file bytes, lowercase hex |
| `from_block` | yes | first block in the sealed range, inclusive |
| `to_block` | yes | last block in the sealed range, inclusive |
| `rows` | yes | row count in the file |
| `file` | yes | `{table}-{hash}.parquet` |
| `registry_snapshot` | no | factory-discovered child-set hash at seal time; absent on a static nest and on pre-RFC-0009 manifests |
| `provisional` | no | `true` when this table had fewer than 1,000 rows at the cut and the next seal will fold it; omitted when `false`, which is every segment sealed before this existed |
| `writer_profile` | no | the writer settings the file was produced with. Absent means `"snappy"`, **not** unknown: every segment sealed before the field existed was that profile |

Two named writer profiles exist:

| profile | compression | blooms | dictionary | sort metadata |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `snappy` | SNAPPY | none | crate default (on) | none |
| `zstd-bloom-v1` | ZSTD level 3 | address, topic and hash columns | off on near-unique 32-byte hashes | rows sorted by `(block_number, log_index)` |

A reader that only decodes Parquet needs neither: the footer describes the file, and both profiles
are ordinary Parquet. The name is there so a reader can tell the two apart **without** opening the
footer, and so a change of bytes is a change of name rather than a silent rewrite. Nuthatch writes
`zstd-bloom-v1` for new seals and never rewrites an existing segment, so one catalogue routinely
holds both.

There is no `sort_order`, no per-column `logical_type`, and no segment-level stats in the
catalogue. Those are [#1223](https://github.com/nightswatchhq/nuthatch/issues/1223),
not this page. Unknown fields should be ignored (the `registry_snapshot` / `provisional`
defaults already work that way).

A catalogue entry whose file is missing is skipped at query time; nuthatch reduces that table
rather than failing the whole nest. An external reader should do the same, or refuse the
table, but not invent rows.

## Ordering

The catalogue **appends**. Listing order is seal order, which is not necessarily block order
(a later seal of an earlier range, or a re-seal, can sit after a newer one).

The order a reader who wants block order must impose, and the one `read_table_rows` uses:

```
(from_block, to_block, hash)
```

Content address breaks ties inside a range, so a re-seal cannot reorder rows. Within one file,
rows are in ingest order for that seal.

nuthatch's DuckDB views union the files in **catalogue order** and do not sort. `ORDER BY
block_number, log_index` if you need a sequence; do not assume the scan comes back in chain
order.

Column order inside a file is the sorted set of JSON keys present on the rows of that seal
(`BTreeSet`). A column no row in the file carries is absent, not null-filled, which is why
`read_parquet(..., union_by_name=true)` (DuckDB) or an equivalent by-name union is the right
scan when a table's schema has drifted across seals.

## 256-bit values, and the rest of the physical schema

`rows_to_batch` writes four columns as `UInt64` and **everything else as `Utf8`**:

| column | Parquet / Arrow type |
| --- | --- |
| `block_number` | `UInt64` (0 if the key is missing) |
| `log_index` | `UInt64` |
| `_seq` | `UInt64` |
| `block_timestamp` | `UInt64` |
| every other key | `Utf8`, nullable (missing or JSON null → null) |

That is the whole type system on disk. A Solidity `uint24` named `fee`, a `bool`, an `address`,
a `bytes32`, and a `uint256` named `value` are all `Utf8`. The four names above are `UInt64`
because they are those names, not because of their Solidity type.

A `uint256` / `int256` (and any other integer wider than 64 bits) is stored as its **canonical
decimal text**: `U256::to_string` / `I256::to_string`, unpadded, no hex, no leading zeros except
for zero itself (`"0"`). Signed values carry a leading minus (`"-100000"`). Addresses and hashes
are `0x` plus lowercase hex. Bools that arrived as JSON booleans stringify to `"true"` /
`"false"`.

That decimal text is lossless. It is also **not bytewise-sortable in numeric order**: `"9"` >
`"10"` as UTF-8. Parquet min/max on a `value` column are lexicographic. An external reader who
wants numeric order casts (checked; see below) or sorts after parsing.

**No silent narrowing.** The exact text is the stored form. Every conversion out of it is either
checked or not offered. nuthatch does not write a `DECIMAL`, a `DOUBLE`, or a 32-byte binary
alongside it.

The gate is `sealed_parquet_writes_uint64_counters_and_utf8_uint256_without_dec_companions` in
`src/seal.rs`. Changing those physical types without changing this page is a red test.

## `c_dec` and `c_overflow` are not in the file

nuthatch's SQL surface derives two view columns for each big-integer column `c` (schema storage
`word16` or `word32`) at DuckDB view definition, in `src/analytics.rs`:

```sql
TRY_CAST("c" AS DECIMAL(38,0)) AS "c_dec",
("c" IS NOT NULL AND TRY_CAST("c" AS DECIMAL(38,0)) IS NULL) AS "c_overflow"
```

`c_dec` is the value as `DECIMAL(38,0)` when it fits, else NULL. `c_overflow` is true when the
exact text is present and that cast is NULL. `SUM(c_dec)` works over the values that fit;
`SUM(c)` is the footgun (it concatenates text, or fails, depending on the engine). Values with
more than 38 digits (a Uniswap `sqrtPriceX96` can) stay exact in `c` and flag on `c_overflow`.

These columns are **never written to Parquet**. An external reader of the raw files does not
get them. Re-derive with the same `TRY_CAST`, or stay on the text. An engine without a checked
cast should not offer a narrowed type; inventing `CAST(c AS DOUBLE)` as the default is silent
narrowing and is not a compatible reading of this format.

Which Utf8 columns are big integers is not in the Parquet schema. nuthatch knows from
`schema.json` (and the live decode registry). An external reader uses that file, or treats
every Utf8 column as text.

The query-side gate is `bigint_columns_get_decimal_and_overflow_views` in `src/analytics.rs`.

## Querying with another engine

List the catalogue, resolve each file, optionally sort, then hand that list to the engine.
Do not glob. `union_by_name` (or the engine's equivalent) is required once a table has more
than one segment whose columns differ.

DuckDB, against a solo nest, after resolving paths into `files`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM read_parquet(['/abs/path/a.parquet', '/abs/path/b.parquet'], union_by_name=true);
```

The same files, with the checked decimal companion a nuthatch view would have offered:

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  TRY_CAST("value" AS DECIMAL(38,0)) AS "value_dec",
  ("value" IS NOT NULL AND TRY_CAST("value" AS DECIMAL(38,0)) IS NULL) AS "value_overflow"
FROM read_parquet(['/abs/path/a.parquet'], union_by_name=true);
```

DataFusion and other Parquet readers take the same path list. Their cast names differ; the
storage contract does not. If the engine cannot express a checked 38-digit decimal, leave the
column as text.

A small resolver matching `segment_path` and the block-order sort, for a dataset directory
`dataset`:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

def segment_files(dataset: Path, table: str) -> list[Path]:
    manifest = json.loads((dataset / "segments" / "manifest.json").read_text())
    segs = sorted(
        manifest["tables"][table],
        key=lambda s: (s["from_block"], s["to_block"], s["hash"]),
    )
    parent = dataset.parent
    shared = parent.parent / "segments" if parent.name == "data" else None
    out = []
    for s in segs:
        if shared is not None:
            p = shared / f"{s['hash']}.parquet"
            if p.exists():
                out.append(p)
                continue
        out.append(dataset / "segments" / s["file"])
    return [p for p in out if p.exists()]
```

That is the migration path. Reading `src/seal.rs` to reconstruct it is not.

## Writer footer, for orientation

`write_parquet` sets SNAPPY and nothing else. A 2026-08-29 footer read of production segments
is in [segment-layout.md](bench/segment-layout.md): column statistics on every column, no Bloom
filters, one row group per file, `parquet-rs` 58.3.0. Those measurements are not a second
schema. Changing them is a writer-config decision and is not implied by this page.

## What this page does not cover

- The hot store, reorgs, or anything unsealed.
- Authored SQL views and incremental entities; those are query-layer, not segment layout.
- The rest of the versioned catalogue (`sort_order`, `logical_type`, stats): #1223. `manifest_version`
  and `writer_profile` shipped ahead of it and are documented above.
- A physical-type change for 256-bit values: #1222.
