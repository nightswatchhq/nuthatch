# Reading a published nest

A nest that runs `nuthatch publish sync`, or `dev`/`serve` with `--publish-target`, mirrors its sealed
history to an object-store prefix or a directory (RFC-0052). This page is the difference between
reading that mirror and reading a nest's own directory. Everything it does not mention is exactly as
[Reading Nuthatch segments without Nuthatch](reading-segments.md) says: ordering, `union_by_name`,
256-bit values as decimal text, and `c_dec`/`c_overflow` not being in the file.

`tests/reading_published_nest.rs` publishes a nest and checks this page against what landed. If the
two disagree, the build fails.

## Layout

```
<target>/
  <dataset>/                  64 lowercase hex characters: the nest's data identity
    publish.json              the provenance envelope, below
    manifest.json             the catalogue, byte-identical to the nest's segments/manifest.json
    schema.json               present when the nest has one
    <table>/
      <hash>.parquet          one object per catalogued, non-provisional segment
```

`<dataset>` is the data identity, not the NID, so a cosmetic edit to a nest does not fork its mirror.
`publish.json` carries the NID and bundle hash of the nest that last published.

## Resolving a file

Resolution rule 0, before the two rules in `reading-segments.md`: on a published prefix, a catalogue
entry for table `t` with hash `h` is the object `<dataset>/<t>/<h>.parquet`. The entry's `file` field
is not used. Provisional entries are never published, so a mirrored catalogue has none.

## Globbing is allowed here, and only here

Locally, never glob `segments/`: it holds provisional segments and files from other nests.
A published `<dataset>/<table>/` holds only catalogued, non-provisional segments of that one table,
plus at most the batch a publisher is uploading now. Those segments are sealed past finality and never
change, so a glob that sees one before the catalogue does sees fresher data, not wrong data. So
`s3://bucket/prefix/<dataset>/usdc__transfer/*.parquet` is a correct table location for Trino, Snowflake,
BigQuery, Databricks or DuckDB.

The mirror is append-only: an object is never removed. When a table's columns differ between segments,
set the engine's by-name column mapping. For Trino's Hive connector that is
`hive.parquet.use-column-names=true`; without it, a table whose columns drifted across seals reads
silently wrong.

## `publish.json`

<!-- publish.json fields: kept in step with the envelope by tests/reading_published_nest.rs -->
| field | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `layout_version` | the version of this prefix layout; `1` |
| `nuthatch_version` | the binary that published |
| `chain_id` | the chain the dataset indexes |
| `data_identity` | the `<dataset>` directory name |
| `nid` | the nest's content address when it last published |
| `bundle_hash` | the nest bundle's hash when it last published |
| `sealed_through` | the mirror is complete through this block |
| `published_at` | RFC 3339 UTC time of the publish; the only non-deterministic field |
| `catalogue_sha256` | SHA-256 of the `manifest.json` this envelope describes |
| `schema_sha256` | SHA-256 of `schema.json`; absent when the nest has none |
| `tables` | the catalogue's table names |
<!-- /publish.json fields -->

**Check `catalogue_sha256` before trusting `sealed_through`.** A publisher writes `manifest.json` first
and `publish.json` second, so for a moment the two can describe different publishes. Read both, and if
`sha256(manifest.json)` is not `catalogue_sha256`, read both again. A reader that skips this can take a
freshness figure for a catalogue it did not read.

## A resolver

For a dataset at `$DATASET`, either a directory or an `s3://` URL. It needs bash, `jq`, and
`sha256sum` (coreutils) or `shasum`; the AWS CLI only for an `s3://` dataset.

```sh
sha256() {
  if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then sha256sum; else shasum -a 256; fi | cut -d' ' -f1
}

fetch() {
  case "$DATASET" in
    s3://*) aws s3 cp "$DATASET/$1" - ;;
    *)      cat "$DATASET/$1" ;;
  esac
}

tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
matched=""
for _ in 1 2 3; do
  fetch manifest.json > "$tmp/manifest.json"
  fetch publish.json > "$tmp/publish.json"
  if [ "$(sha256 < "$tmp/manifest.json")" = \
       "$(jq -r .catalogue_sha256 "$tmp/publish.json")" ]; then
    matched=1
    break
  fi
done
[ -n "$matched" ] || { echo "publish.json never matched manifest.json" >&2; exit 1; }

jq -r --arg t "$TABLE" --arg d "$DATASET" \
  '.tables[$t] | sort_by(.from_block, .to_block, .hash)[] | "\($d)/\($t)/\(.hash).parquet"' \
  "$tmp/manifest.json"
```

It prints one file per segment in block order, ready for `read_parquet([...], union_by_name=true)` or
any engine that takes a list. The hash is taken over the fetched file, not a shell variable, because
command substitution drops trailing newlines and the check would never match.

## What this page does not cover

How a warehouse registers the prefix. RFC-0052 §5 has the recipes, and a recipe is listed as supported
only once it has been run against a real mirror.
