# The runtime admin API

A runtime (`nuthatch dev --dir <dir>` over a directory holding a `mounts.toml`) manages its own nests.
A caller hands it a nest identity (NID) and the runtime fetches it, verifies it, stores it, indexes it
and serves it. This page is the whole surface for a platform or a script driving that lifecycle
(#1552). Nothing here knows who the caller is: sign-in, plans, billing and per-tenant authorisation
belong to whatever sits in front of the runtime.

## Starting a runtime to be driven

```toml
# mounts.toml
[runtime]
name = "fleet-1"

[[chains]]
chain = "mainnet"
chain_id = 1
rpc_urls = ["https://…"]
```

```sh
NUTHATCH_ADMIN_TOKEN=… nuthatch dev --dir fleet-1 --listen 0.0.0.0:8288 --registry s3://bucket/nests
```

- **Chains are declared here, at boot.** A runtime may start with nothing mounted; the first mount onto
  a chain starts that chain's cursor and dials its RPC only then. Chains cannot be added over the API.
- **`--registry`** is where a mount fetches a NID the runtime does not hold: a filesystem path or
  `s3://bucket/prefix`. Publish to it with `nuthatch nest publish <bundle> --registry <path>`; a NID is
  what `nuthatch nest nid --dir <dir>` prints. Without `--registry`, only NIDs already under `data/` mount.
- **Off localhost the API needs `NUTHATCH_ADMIN_TOKEN`**, presented as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  or `?token=<token>`. Without the variable an off-localhost runtime serves no admin routes at all.
  `--no-admin` removes them everywhere.
- **Request bodies are JSON** and need `Content-Type: application/json`; without it a `POST` is
  answered `415`.

## The lifecycle

| Do | Call | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| Mount a NID under a name | `POST /_admin/nests` `{"name": "usdc", "nid": "<nid>"}` | `202` and the job |
| Read a mount's progress | `GET /_admin/mounts/<name>` | the job |
| List every mount | `GET /_admin/mounts` | `{"mounts": [job, …]}` |
| Price a mount first | `POST /_admin/nests?dry_run=true` with the same body | `200` and a report |
| Pause a mount | `POST /_admin/suspend/<name>` | `200` |
| Resume it | `POST /_admin/resume/<name>` | `202` and the job |
| Move a name to a new NID | `POST /_admin/move/<name>` `{"nid": "<new nid>"}` | `202` and the job |
| Unmount | `DELETE /_admin/nests/<name>` | `200`, with `"was_mounted": false` when there was nothing to unmount (a retry is not a failure); `400` for a name no mount could have |
| Unmount and free the disk | `DELETE /_admin/nests/<name>?reclaim=true` | `200` and the reclaim |
| Free a dataset unmounted earlier | `DELETE /_admin/datasets/<nid>` | `200`, `409` kept, `404` absent |

`<name>` is the route the nest serves at, `/<name>/…`: `usdc` for the runtime's default tenant, and
`acme/usdc` for any other tenant. Each mount's route depends on its own tenant alone, so it never
changes on a restart, whatever else is mounted. A name is one or two parts, `alias` or `tenant/alias`,
each of letters, digits, `_` and `-` and at most 64 characters; an alias may not end in `__moving`,
which a move reserves, and the default tenant is never spelled out (`usdc`, not `default/usdc`, nor
`acme/usdc` when `[runtime] default_tenant = "acme"`). Any
other name is refused with `400` before anything is recorded. `/<name>/ready` answers for the nest
itself, and `GET /nests` lists the roster.

### Mounts are jobs

A mount can take minutes when it fetches, so it answers `202` at once with a job:

```json
{"name": "usdc", "nid": "9f2c…", "phase": "accepted", "since_unixtime": 1790700000}
```

`phase` moves through `accepted`, `fetching` (only when the registry is needed), `joining` (catching up
beside the cursor before it joins), and ends at `live` or `failed`, with a `reason` on a failure. A
suspended mount reads `suspended`. Poll
`GET /_admin/mounts/<name>`; reading it never waits on a mount in progress. Unfinished jobs survive a
restart and resume; failed ones stay readable until the name is mounted again or unmounted.

**`live` means indexing and serving, not caught up.** A mount joining a chain that already has a
cursor catches up beside it before it goes live. The first mount onto a chain starts that chain's
cursor and backfills inside it, so it is `live` while history is still arriving. Read
`/<name>/ready` for the distance: `lag_blocks` is how far behind the tip it is, and `ready` stays
`true` while it catches up, since readiness means serving and advancing.

A second `POST` of the same name and NID is idempotent: `202` with the running job, or `200` once it is
live. The same name with another NID is `409`; changing a live mount's nest is a move.

`?wait=true` answers only when the mount has finished, with the synchronous statuses below. Use it from
a script; a platform should poll.

### Refusals

| Status | Why |
|---|---|
| `400` | a malformed NID, or a name the runtime would not accept (see above) |
| `404` | the runtime does not hold the NID and was started without `--registry` |
| `409` | the name is taken, the chain is not declared, or the chain's cursor has died (restart the runtime) |
| `507` | the mount would breach the chain cursor's RAM ceiling; the reason carries projected and ceiling MB |

On the job route a refusal ends the job `failed` with the same reason. With `--registry`, a NID the
registry does not hold is accepted like any mount and ends the job `failed`, its reason naming the NID;
with `?wait=true` it answers `500` with the same reason. A mount the runtime fetched and
then refused is removed again: a refusal leaves nothing on disk.

### Dry run

`POST /_admin/nests?dry_run=true` runs the same admission checks a mount does and mounts nothing. If the
NID has to be fetched it is fetched and verified, and stays installed.

```json
{
  "name": "usdc", "nid": "9f2c…", "fetched": true, "shares": null,
  "chain": "mainnet", "start_block": 6082465, "tip": 21000000, "blocks_to_backfill": 14917535,
  "has_data": false, "per_block_rpc": ["[extract] blocks"],
  "incoming_mb": 180, "projected_mb": 420, "ceiling_mb": 2048,
  "refusal": null, "refusal_status": null
}
```

`refusal_status` is the status a real mount would answer. `tip` is known only for a chain whose cursor
is running; a dry run dials nothing. `per_block_rpc` lists extraction that costs calls per block beyond
the shared `eth_getLogs`, which is what makes a nest expensive to index. `shares` names a mount that
already indexes this dataset, in which case the mount costs nothing further.

### Suspend and resume

A suspended mount leaves its cursor, releases its store and answers `503` with `"suspended": true` in
place of its routes. Its data and record stay, and it stays suspended across a restart
(`mounts.toml` lists it under `suspended`). Resume catches it up from where it stopped. Resuming a
quarantined mount is its explicit release.

### Moving a name

`POST /_admin/move/<name>` mounts the new NID beside the old one, catches it up, then switches the
name's routes in one step. A reader polling `/<name>/` sees the old nest, then the new, and never an
error between. The old nest is then taken off its cursor. A move keeps its chain.

### Reclaiming disk

Unmounting keeps the dataset, so a remount is free. `?reclaim=true` on the unmount, or
`DELETE /_admin/datasets/<nid>` later, removes it once no mount names it; a dataset another mount still
uses is kept and the answer says by whom:

```json
{"outcome": "kept", "nid": "9f2c…", "mounted_by": ["acme/usdc"]}
```

Inside a running runtime this removes the dataset and the segments only it references. Segments a live
fold left behind stay for an offline `nuthatch prune`.

## What to meter

The runtime serves `/metrics` at its root, before anything is mounted, with per-nest series labelled `{nest="<name>"}`, among them
`nuthatch_nest_hot_store_bytes`, `nuthatch_nest_sealed_segments_bytes`, `nuthatch_nest_last_block` and
`nuthatch_nest_tip_lag_blocks`. A segment two datasets share counts under both, so for disk used read
the unlabelled `nuthatch_sealed_segments_bytes`. See [operators.md](operators.md#observability).
