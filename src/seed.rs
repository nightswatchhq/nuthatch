//! Seed a nest that has not indexed from a published mirror, instead of an RPC backfill
//! (RFC-0052 §8).
//!
//! The mirror's catalogue and each table's provisional tail (the `_seed/` snapshot) are downloaded,
//! every file is checked against its content address, and the store is left exactly as a
//! `--seal-direct` backfill leaves it on finishing at the snapshot's `complete_through`. The first
//! `dev` is then a warm start: it folds the segments and follows the chain from the next block.
//!
//! The hashes prove each file is the one the mirror's own catalogue names, so nothing changed in
//! transit or at rest. They prove nothing about who wrote the catalogue or whether it is true to the
//! chain. That is decided by whose mirror the operator points at.
