//! RFC-0053 S0: the migration validator (#1264).
//!
//! Runs a corpus of real GraphQL operations against a reference Graph endpoint and against a nest,
//! and reports every way the two answers differ. It is the instrument #1212 needs as well, which is
//! why the sprint builds it once: RFC-0044 §10 wants a ported nest diffed against a reference field
//! by field, and this is that diff with the operations supplied by the caller.
//!
//! **The property that shapes the whole module: a clean result must not be obtainable by dropping
//! unsupported selections.** The obvious way to write a validator like this is to walk the two
//! responses and compare the keys they have in common, which is exactly wrong - a nest that answers
//! `{ id }` for a query asking `{ id, volumeUSD }` would then be reported as agreeing, and the
//! caller would migrate on the strength of it. So the comparison is driven by **what the query
//! asked for**, never by what either side happened to return, and a field that is requested and
//! absent is a divergence with its own name rather than a silence.
