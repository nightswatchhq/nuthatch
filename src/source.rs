/// a node - it matches everything. A nest with no contract at all (`[extract] blocks = true` and no
/// `[[contracts]]`, OBIB case 3) produces exactly that pair, so the request succeeds and returns an
/// answer that is wrong rather than absent: every log on the chain, fetched and then discarded, since
/// no log can decode without a matching address or topic. The bench harness builds such a registry
/// directly and does reach it; `build_nest` currently refuses the config outright, so the *nest*
/// paths are guarded ahead of the configuration rather than behind it - see
/// `a_contract_free_nest_cannot_be_built_at_all_today` in `indexer.rs`.
///
/// This type exists because the per-call-site guard was written **three times and missed a path each
/// time** - #421 guarded `backfill_direct`, #429 guarded `fetch_logs_splitting`, and both left the two
/// live tip loops issuing it forever (#432). Enumerating call sites is the losing move: the set grows,
/// and a new one is a silent regression rather than a compile error.
///
/// So the guard moves into the type. [`LogFilter::new`] is the only constructor and returns `None` for
/// the empty-and-empty case, and [`Source::logs`] takes a `&LogFilter` rather than two slices. A caller
/// therefore *cannot* hold a value that means every log on the chain, and a new call site cannot ask
/// for one without first deciding what "nothing to ask for" means there. The check is at the type
