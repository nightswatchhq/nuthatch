//! RFC-0041 §4 step 4: the DBSP circuit a [`Plan`] lowers to (#870).
//!
//! §5.1 says each decoded window is *"converted to the circuit's input relations and applied at
//! weight `+1`"*. Slice 0 could not do that for any plan but one, because its circuit was built over
//! concrete Rust structs. [`entity_row`](crate::entity_row) answered whether a dynamic row can carry
//! DBSP's operator bounds at all (it can); [`entity_plan`](crate::entity_plan) settled the lowered
//! shape and built the batch oracle. This module is the join between them: **a circuit constructed
//! from a `Plan` at nest load, with no generated Rust, no `cargo`, no JVM and no external
//! compiler** - the plan drives the operators, and the operators are parameterised by column index
//! rather than by Rust field.
//!
//! ## How an entity faults
//!
//! DBSP operators are infallible by signature: a `filter` closure returns `bool`, not
//! `Result<bool>`. Every fault this module can raise - a type error in an expression, division by
//! zero, an aggregate that leaves `i128` - therefore leaves through a **panic inside the circuit
//! worker**, which DBSP catches and returns from [`DBSPHandle::transaction`] as
//! `RuntimeError::WorkerPanic`. [`EntityCircuit::apply`] turns that back into an `Err`.
//!
//! This is dbsp's own idiom rather than an invention: `dbsp::algebra::CheckedInt` is documented as
//! *"Ring on numeric values that panics on overflow"* and exists for exactly this. It also gives the
//! isolation the runtime needs - the panic is caught by *this* circuit's runtime, so one entity
//! faulting cannot take down another nest's cursor, nor the process.
//!
//! A faulted circuit is dead, deliberately: §3.3.1 wants the entity to stop and be visibly stopped
//! (#866), not to carry on with a wrapped number in it.
//!
//! ## Which aggregate gets which operator
//!
//! - `count`, `sum` and `avg` are **linear**: one [`LinAcc`] carries every linear slot the plan
//!   needs, so a plan with four aggregates still builds one `aggregate_linear` rather than four.
//! - `min`/`max` are **not linear under retraction** - retracting the current maximum does not tell
//!   you the next one - so each uses dbsp's [`Max`]/[`Min`] aggregator, which walks the group's
//!   value cursor from the extreme end and takes the first value whose accumulated weight is
//!   non-zero. Correct under retraction, at the cost of a scan per changed group.
//! - `avg` is carried as sum and count to the end and divided once (§3.3), never as a running mean.
//!
//! The min/max results are grafted onto the linear row by an outer join on the group key, so a group
//! whose min-input is entirely NULL still emits with a NULL there rather than vanishing.
