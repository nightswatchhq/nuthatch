//! `nuthatch migrate` - move a runtime from the name-keyed layout to identity-keyed datasets
//! (RFC-0032 §8, slice 1).
//!
//! Before: `<root>/nests/<name>/` - an operator's label decides where data lives. After:
//! `<root>/data/<nid>/`, addressed by what the nest *is*, with `mounts.toml` carrying `[[mounts]]`
//! records mapping alias → identity.
//!
//! **Data is moved, never re-indexed.** If a migration ever needs a backfill, the migration is wrong.
//!
//! Two properties matter more than speed:
//!
//! - **Idempotent.** Running it twice is a no-op. Running it after adding one nest migrates only that
//!   nest. There is no "already migrated" error to work around.
//! - **Refuses rather than guesses.** A nest whose inputs no longer reproduce its own manifest is
//!   named and skipped, and the whole run reports a failure. A half-migrated mounts still serves,
//!   because [`crate::runtime::MountTable::dir_for`] resolves both layouts.
//!
//! **Deviation from RFC-0032 §12, recorded deliberately.** The RFC specified copy-then-verify-then-
//! swap. This uses `rename` when source and destination share a filesystem - which they do, both
//! being under the runtime root - and falls back to copy-verify-remove only across devices. A rename is
//! atomic: it cannot produce the half-written destination the copy path exists to guard against, and
//! it does not require double the disk of an indexed history. The RFC's *intent* was "never lose
//! data"; rename serves it better than the mechanism the RFC named.
