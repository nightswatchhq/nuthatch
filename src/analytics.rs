//! Read-only analytical SQL over the sealed Parquet segments **and the hot tip**, on Burrmill
//! (`engine_burrmill`). The sealed segments cover finalized history; the unsealed tip lives in redb.
//! For `/sql` (RFC-0013) the hot rows are handed to the session per table and unioned into each
//! table's view. Hot and cold are kept disjoint *structurally* by the `sealed_through` watermark
//! (COR-1): cold includes only segments finalized at/below it, hot only rows past it - so the union
//! is exact with no dedup, even across the brief seal→prune window. Trusted point-reads pass no hot
//! rows (and `u64::MAX`, i.e. all segments).
//!
//! Memory is capped so an analytical query can't blow the embedded-mode RAM budget.
