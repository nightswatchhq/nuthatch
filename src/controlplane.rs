//! The control plane (RFC-0022 §3): **desired state**, and who is available to run it.
//!
//! Two tables and no cleverness. `desired_nest` is what the operator asked for; `worker` is who is
//! currently alive to serve it. The scheduler ([`crate::scheduler::plan`]) reads both and decides
//! placement; nothing here decides anything.
//!
//! ## What this holds, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! It holds **intent**. It does *not* hold ownership - which worker currently runs which cursor lives
//! in the hot store, next to the fence, for the reasons argued in RFC-0022's lease-placement note: a
//! lease and a fence in two different databases can disagree, and that disagreement is exactly the
//! split brain the fence exists to prevent.
//!
//! The practical consequence is worth stating, because it looks like a gap: **the control plane can
//! be wrong about what is running and nothing breaks.** It is a statement of what *should* be true.
//! Reconciliation reads ownership from the hot stores, which cannot be stale, because a lease is only
//! meaningful in the transaction that took it.
//!
//! ## Secrets
//!
//! Runtime secrets (RFC-0019 §4 credential kind **b**) live here too, keyed by nest. They are stored
//! **outside** the content-addressed bundle on purpose: baking a credential into a bundle would leak
//! it *and* break addressing, because two nests differing only in credentials would hash differently.
//! Rotating a secret is a control-plane write that changes no bundle hash.
//!
//! The interface is **write-only**. Values go in and are handed to the worker that mounts the nest;
//! no method returns one to an operator, and the HTTP surface exposes only key names. A control plane
//! that can read back every credential it holds is a credential dump with extra steps.
//!
//! ## Liveness
//!
//! A worker is alive if it has heartbeated within its TTL, measured on the **database's** clock - the
//! same discipline as the lease, and for the same reason. A worker whose own clock ran fast would
//! otherwise declare itself alive after everyone else had written it off, and the fleet would plan
//! around a machine that is not there.
//!
//! Losing the heartbeat does **not** stop a worker writing: that is the lease's job, and it expires
//! on its own schedule. The two are deliberately independent - a control plane outage must not stop
//! ingestion, only stop *rescheduling*.
