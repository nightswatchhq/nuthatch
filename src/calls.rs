//! RFC-0023 tier 3 - **pinned-block `eth_call` as a host-side ingestion source.**
//!
//! Tiers 1-2 remove most `eth_call`s by *deriving* state from events (`recipes.rs`) and caching
//! immutable metadata (`metadata.rs`). This module handles what is left: the **irreducible residue** -
//! an oracle read, an ungoverned parameter, a view on a contract whose events we do not fully cover.
//!
//! Three properties make a call result safe to store, and all three come from pinning the block:
//!
//! 1. **Deterministic.** `result = f(code, storage, block, calldata)`. Re-executing the same
//!    declaration at the same block on another machine next year returns the same bytes. `latest`
//!    would break this, which is why [`crate::rpc::RpcClient::eth_call`] is documented as
//!    out-of-band-only and the data path uses `eth_call_at`.
//! 2. **Content-addressable** by `(chain, block, contract, calldata)` - see [`CallKey`]. The address
//!    *is* the identity, so two operators who run the same declaration over the same range produce
//!    byte-identical results and can share segments (tier 4) without trusting each other.
//! 3. **Host-run.** The host issues the call and hands components only *data*, so components stay
//!    zero-capability and pure and may still feed entity derivation.
//!
//! **What this is not:** a way to read `latest`. Nothing here ever touches the chain tip - a nest that
//! wants live state wants a different tool, and asking for it here would trade the determinism
//! non-negotiable for convenience.
