/// loudest exactly when it had measured nothing at all. That is the "a criterion phrased as the

/// five times, and `footprint.sh` guards its own version of it by asserting the row count before
/// comparing the peak. Requiring the reads is the same guard.

/// A limit that is not passed is neither a pass nor a failure: it is simply not asked for, which is
/// how an operator running the bench by hand should experience it.
///
/// **The failure message names where to re-baseline, because the obvious place used to be the wrong
/// one.** It once said "re-baselining against a committed report", and the only committed report was
/// `docs/bench/point-read.json` - a 32-core dev-box number (p50 1.24µs) that `docs/benchmarks.md`
/// explicitly told the reader was *not* what the ceiling was set against (the runner's baseline is
/// 0.59-0.82µs). Following the instruction re-derived a runner ceiling from dev-box hardware, and
/// this gate is the one that already proved baseline and regression do not scale together across
/// machines: the scan mutation ran *faster* on the runner (18.15µs) than on the dev box (24.17µs).
/// So the message pointed at the enforcing machine and explicitly away from the file.
///
/// #385 fixed the file rather than the sentence: `docs/bench/point-read.json` is now an artifact
/// lifted from a green `main` run of the `point-read latency` job, so it records the runner's own
/// numbers and the message can name it again. The dev-box record moved to

/// it is still in the tree and is still the artifact a reader might reach for. The instruction that
