# The ≤2 GB per-cursor RAM budget, ABI-breadth half (#286).
#
# `multinest-footprint.sh` answers density and event *rate* (twenty nests, ten events). This answers
# ABI *breadth*: one nest, 31 event types (the SubgraphService figure named on #286), 31 logs/block
# so every table is hit every block, at tip after a backfill. More decoders, more tables, more
# keyspaces - a different pressure on the hot store than more rows through the same ten tables.
#
# Hermetic: multinest-rpc.py serves the chain, the nest is written inline, topic0s come from the
# generated ABI. No secret, a fork can satisfy it.
#
# Absence-test guard: FINAL_TIP reached, row floor, **every one of the 31 tables non-empty**.
#
# MAX_RSS_MB=2048 is the product promise. REGRESSION_MB is unset until this scenario has a runner
# noise band of its own - do not copy the density job's 180 MB here.
