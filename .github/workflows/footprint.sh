# Measure peak resident memory of a single-chain index and enforce a ceiling.
#
# Runs the documented scenario - a nest, then `dev --backfill` - samples peak RSS while it indexes,
# and fails if it exceeds MAX_RSS_MB. The ceiling is set generously (256 MB) above the measured ~37 MB
# for a single contract, so this catches a regression rather than policing noise.
#
# **This talks to no third party.** It used to index mainnet USDC over the shipped public endpoints,
# which cost us twice (issue #260):
#
#   1. Repository secrets are not exposed to fork pull requests, so an external contribution could
#      never satisfy a *required* check. It failed on the honest "indexed 0 transfers, refusing to
#      false-pass" path, and a maintainer had to read the log and wave it through - which is how a
#      gate stops meaning anything. Our first external PR (#253) hit exactly this.
#   2. The number was not comparable between runs. Peak RSS depended on how many blocks a
#      rate-limited endpoint happened to serve, so "did this change cost us memory?" was unanswerable.
#
# Both are fixed by serving the chain ourselves (footprint-rpc.py) and checking in the nest instead of
# calling `init`, which removes the ABI-resolution round trip too. Every run indexes exactly the same
# logs, so a change in peak RSS is a change in nuthatch.
#
# Env: BIN (default target/release/nuthatch), MAX_RSS_MB (default 256), PORT (default 8288),
#      RPC_PORT (default 8545).

# A fixed amount of work, so peak RSS is comparable between runs. The mock serves LOGS_PER_BLOCK=4
# `Transfer`s for every block, and `--backfill N` indexes the last N blocks from the tip - so the run
# is complete at exactly BACKFILL_BLOCKS x 4 rows, and we wait for that rather than stopping at
# whichever poll first crossed a threshold. Stopping early was the old behaviour and it made the
# number depend on how fast the machine happened to be, which is the comparability this check exists
# to provide.
