# The ≤2 GB per-cursor RAM budget, measured on the adversarial case and enforced (issues #286, #284).
#
# CLAUDE.md non-negotiable 2: **≤2 GB RAM per active-chain cursor**, shared across whatever nests sit
# on that cursor - density is RAM-bounded, not free. RFC-0021 makes the budget per-cursor rather than
# per-runtime. This measures it and fails the build when it is breached.
#
# ## Why this exists next to `footprint.sh` rather than inside it
#
# They measure different things and both are wanted. `footprint.sh` is the *single-nest backfill*
# check: one contract, one event type (USDC `Transfer`), a fixed tip, 8004 rows, ceiling 256 MB. It
# is a sensitive regression detector precisely because its scenario is small - 60 MB against a 256 MB
# ceiling notices a leak that a 2 GB ceiling never would.
#
# This is the *budget* check: the product promise, on the case most likely to break it. Neither
# subsumes the other, and the two ceilings are deliberately not the same number:
#
#   footprint.sh    one nest, one event, backfill      ceiling  256 MB   "did a change cost us memory"
#   this            N nests, ten events, at tip        ceiling 2048 MB   "do we still hold the budget"
#
# The ceilings must never be reconciled into one. A single number cannot be both a tight regression
# tripwire and the product's stated budget.
#
# ## What makes the scenario adversarial
#
#   - **Large ABI.** The real Uniswap V4 `PoolManager` ABI (nightswatchhq/uniswap-v4-ethereum): ten
#     events, `Initialize` and `Swap` eight inputs each. Ten topic0 registrations and ten tables per
#     nest, against `footprint.sh`'s one.
#   - **Dense.** NESTS nests on ONE cursor - the density the budget is stated in terms of.
#   - **High event rate.** Every contract emits LOGS_PER_BLOCK logs every block.
#   - **At tip.** The mock's tip *moves* (see multinest-rpc.py), so once the backfill drains the
#     cursor spends the rest of the run on the live path - near-tip window, finality, sealing. A
#     fixed tip only ever measures a backfill, and the budget is about sustained operation.
#
# ## The absence-test guard, which is the important half
#
# "Peak RSS stayed under 2 GB" passes trivially when the scenario indexed nothing, and a gate that
# measures nothing is green forever. This project has been caught by that repeatedly. So the check
# refuses to pass unless it can show it did the work:
#
#   - every nest reached FINAL_TIP, and
#   - every nest holds at least MIN_ROWS_PER_NEST rows, and
#   - **all ten tables of every nest are non-empty** - which is also what proves each topic0 landed,
#     since a wrong topic0 does not error, it silently yields an empty table.
#
# Any of those failing is a FAIL, not a pass with a caveat.
#
# ## Two ceilings, because they answer two questions (#286 and #284)
#
# `MAX_RSS_MB` (2048) is the **budget**: the product promise from CLAUDE.md. It is not derived from
# any measurement and must not be tuned to fit one - if a change breaches it, the change is wrong.
#
# `REGRESSION_MB` is the **regression ceiling**, and it exists because the budget alone is not a
# regression gate. This scenario measures ~143 MB against a 2048 MB budget, so a change could cost us
# ten times the memory and still pass the budget. A gate that cannot fail is not coverage. The
# regression ceiling is set just outside the observed run-to-run noise band, so it catches drift while
# staying quiet on noise - a flaky gate gets disabled, and a disabled gate is worse than none.
#
# They are nested, never reconciled: REGRESSION_MB << MAX_RSS_MB, and a breach of each says something
# different. Unset REGRESSION_MB to report without enforcing it.
#
# ## The defaults are the enforced scenario, deliberately (#395)
#
# Every scenario knob below defaults to exactly what the `per-cursor RAM budget` CI job runs, so
# `bash .github/workflows/multinest-footprint.sh` with no environment measures the thing the gate
# enforces - and so does `scripts/multinest-rss-spread.sh`, which forwards only BIN/PORT/RPC_PORT and
# otherwise inherits these. That is not tidiness. The defaults were once a fifth of the enforced
# scenario (8 nests / 641 blocks / ~51k rows against 20 / 1201 / 240k), on a metric this same file
# shows to be size-sensitive, so anyone following the FAIL message's own re-baseline instruction
# measured a smaller run and derived a ceiling *below* the healthy enforced figure. Applying it
# reddens the gate permanently; distrusting it makes the tooling folklore. A knob whose default is a
# scenario nobody enforces is a trap with a comment on it, so the knobs stay and the defaults moved.
#
# CI therefore sets only what is genuinely the job's own: the enforcement policy (REGRESSION_MB) and
# where to write the artifact (REPORT). It must not restate the scenario - two copies drift, and the
# copy in the harness is the one every human and every tool reads.
#
