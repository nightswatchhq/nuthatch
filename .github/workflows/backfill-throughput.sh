# Backfill events/sec on a fixed, locally served chain: tracked on every PR, not gated (#1723).
#
# `nuthatch bench backfill --seal-direct --concurrency 4` over blocks 1 to 20,000 of the chain
# footprint-rpc.py serves: one contract, four Transfers a block, 80,000 rows. It is RFC-0052 S2's
# scenario (scripts/publish-throughput-gate.sh) without the mirror, so there is no third party and no
# secret. BATCHES batches of RUNS runs; the bench reports each batch's median, and the figure reported
# is the median of those.
#
# Why there is no floor: the runner's batches agree to 4.2%, but the scenario cannot see the
# regressions a floor would exist for. A 4x decode cost moved it about 1%, and on the 4-core runner
# concurrency 1 reads faster than 4. docs/benchmarks.md has the figures.
#
# Env: BIN (target/release/nuthatch), OUT (backfill-throughput-report.json), BATCHES (3), RUNS (15),
#      CONCURRENCY (4), RPC_PORT (8547).
