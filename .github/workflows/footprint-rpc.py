"""A deterministic EVM RPC, just complete enough to back a footprint measurement.

The RAM budget is a **required** check, and it used to be measured against free public endpoints.
That had two costs. Repository secrets are not exposed to fork pull requests, so an external
contribution could never satisfy it - it failed on the honest "indexed 0 transfers, refusing to
false-pass" path and a maintainer had to read the log and wave it through, which is how a gate stops
meaning anything (issue #260). And the number itself was not comparable between runs: peak RSS
depended on how many blocks a rate-limited endpoint felt like serving that morning.

Serving the chain ourselves fixes both. Every run indexes exactly the same logs, so a change in peak
RSS is a change in nuthatch. No network, no secrets, no flake, and identical behaviour on a fork.

Deliberately NOT a general-purpose mock: it answers the four methods a backfill actually calls and
rejects everything else loudly, so a future method silently returning `null` cannot look like an
empty chain.
