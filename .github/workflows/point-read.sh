# Measure entity point-read p50/p99 and enforce a ceiling (issue #283).
#
# CLAUDE.md names entity point-read p50/p99 as a CI artifact whose regressions fail the build.
# `nuthatch bench query` has measured it for a while; nothing compared the number to anything, so it
# was a print statement rather than a gate and every perf change to the storage path could regress it
# in silence.
#
# The chain is served locally by `multinest-rpc.py` and the nest is written here rather than fetched,
# so there is **no secret and no third party** (issue #260). A fork PR can satisfy this check, and
# every run reads exactly the same rows - so a change in p99 is a change in nuthatch and not in
# somebody's rate limiter.
#
# **The scenario is the `per-cursor RAM budget` job's** (issue #424): the real ten-event Uniswap V4
# `PoolManager` ABI at 200 logs a block, leaving 12,800 rows hot across ten tables once everything
# past finality has sealed. It used to be `footprint.sh`'s single-event fixture, whose settled tip is
# 256 rows - a hot store small enough that a 32-core dev box and a 4-core runner measured the same
# number, which is a precise measurement of a case nobody runs. See the fixture block below.
#
# The ceilings were chosen by breaking the code on purpose and seeing what the numbers did, rather
# than by leaving "plenty of headroom" - see the justification in ci.yml, which carries the measured
# pair for the fixture in force.
#
# **p99 and p99.9 are recorded and gated on by nothing**, and that is a deliberate design call rather
# than an omission. Gating p50 loosely and tracking the tail precisely are two different jobs: a p99
# ceiling tight enough to catch a real regression flakes on a shared runner, and one loose enough not
# to flake catches nothing. This is not a judgement call here - it was measured. The linear-scan
# mutation that p50 catches at 18.15µs against an 8µs ceiling only moved p99 to 34.45µs, so the 150µs
# p99 backstop this script used to apply did **not** fire on the one regression the gate exists to
# catch. A ceiling that passes the known break is not a weak gate, it is decoration that reads as
# coverage. The tail is the number we track across releases and read with our eyes, in the artifact.
#
# `MAX_P99_US` therefore has no default. Set it to gate the tail deliberately (an operator on a quiet
# machine may well want to); leave it unset and p99 is reported and not enforced.
#
# **Running this on your own machine:** 8µs is `ubuntu-latest`'s number, and applying a ceiling
# measured on one machine to a different one is the mistake this gate already made once. A slower or
# busier box can fail it without anything being wrong, so raise it - `MAX_P50_US=200 bash
# .github/workflows/point-read.sh` reports the numbers without gating on them in any useful sense.
# There is deliberately no "off" for p50: it always applies, and `MAX_P50_US=0` would fail every run
# rather than disable the check. What CI enforces is set in ci.yml and is not affected by this
# default.
#
# **`BASELINE` checks the committed reference came from this machine** (issue #385).
# `docs/bench/point-read.json` is the number anyone re-baselining the ceiling will reach for, and for
# a year it was a 32-core dev-box artifact while the gate ran on a 4-core runner. Nothing detected
# that, because a committed JSON file cannot go stale loudly - it can only be read and believed. So
# CI now points `BASELINE` at it and this script compares the `hardware` the baseline records against
# the `hardware` the run it just did records. Mismatch is a hard failure.
#
# It compares provenance and **not values**, deliberately. A "measured p50 must be within Nx of the
# baseline" check is a second, much tighter ceiling wearing a different hat: the runner's own p50 has
# been seen from 0.58µs to 0.82µs at fixed commits and its p99.9 from 0.77µs to 23.02µs, so any factor
# loose enough not to flake is looser than the 8µs gate already is, and any factor tight enough to
# add information flakes. The one thing a committed baseline can be *definitively* wrong about is
# which machine produced it, so that is what is enforced.
#
# Unset by default, because the answer is machine-dependent and this script is documented for running
# by hand: on your own box the check would fail correctly and uselessly every time. What CI enforces
# is set in ci.yml.
#
# **Every scenario knob defaults to the enforced scenario** (#395's lesson, applied here by #424).
# `bash .github/workflows/point-read.sh` with no environment measures the thing CI gates, so anyone
# re-baselining from the tool's own default measures the right shape. The RSS harness once defaulted
# to a fifth of its enforced scenario while its FAIL message pointed people at the harness, which
# lands a re-derived ceiling *below* the healthy figure. CI therefore sets only what is genuinely the
# job's own - enforcement policy and where to write the artifact - and must not restate the scenario.

# --- the fixture: a realistic nest, not a settled tip of 256 rows (issue #424) -------------------
#
# **The scenario is the gate.** #283's design call asked for the shape #286/#284 would actually
# perturb - "the hot store under a realistic nest, the same scenario family the RAM work will load" -
# and the first version of this script did not deliver it. It borrowed `footprint.sh`'s fixture: one
# contract, one event, four logs a block. Everything past finality is sealed to Parquet and pruned
# out of redb, and `get_entity` is a hot-store read, so what the gate actually measured was
# 64 blocks x 4 logs = **256 rows** - a hot store that fits in L2 cache, which is why a 32-core dev
# box and a 4-core runner produced the same number. Precise, cheap, and a measurement of a case
# nobody runs.
#
# So the fixture is now the `per-cursor RAM budget` job's chain, served by the same
# `multinest-rpc.py` off the same real Uniswap V4 `PoolManager` ABI: ten event types, ten tables, and
# **200 logs per block**. That is the rate the RSS scenario puts on one cursor (20 nests x 10
# logs/block/contract), carried here by a single high-rate contract so that it lands in one nest's
# store - which is the store a point-read seeks in, since each nest gets its own redb. The hot store
# is 64 x 200 = **12,800 rows across 10 tables**, 50x what it was and the same order as the cursor
# the RAM work loads.
#
# Two gates, one chain shape, on purpose. `footprint.sh` stays on its small single-event fixture
# because a 256 MB ceiling over 60 MB is a sensitive regression tripwire; this one wants the dense
# case because a point-read gate's discriminating power is a function of how many rows a broken
# read path would have to walk.
#
# `--contracts 1` rather than 20: one nest with 20 aliases would carry 200 tables, not 10, and the
# table count is part of the shape being matched. The event *rate* is what sizes the hot store.

# the hot store - and `get_entity` is a hot-store read. Measured on the old fixture: sealed_through
# 19,936 against a 20,000 tip, so exactly `FINALITY_DEPTH` blocks stay hot.
#
# This is written down because the first version of this script asserted `--min-reads 8004` and
# therefore failed *every* run: it was reasoned from the backfill size rather than run. If nuthatch's
# finality or sealing changes, this goes red and wants a human, which is the correct outcome rather
# than a silently shrinking sample.
#
# Named rather than left as a bare `64 * 200`, because both numbers are quotations from elsewhere and
# a reader who cannot see the source cannot check them: mainnet is `Finality::Depth(64)`
# (`src/chains.rs:77`) and the mock serves `--logs-per-block` per contract per block up to a fixed
# `TIP`, so the settled hot tip is blocks 19937..=20000.
#
# It is a **floor, not an equality**. A run whose seal loop has not caught up holds *more* than this,
