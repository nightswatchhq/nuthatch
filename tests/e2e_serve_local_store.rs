//! #520: `serve` without `--hot-store` used to be `Store::open` - create-if-missing, commits a write
//! txn, holds the exclusive flock - on the role `cli.rs`'s own help called **read-only** and shared.
//! None of that was true: it brought an empty store into being for a nest never indexed (#413's
//! mistake at a site #413 did not cover), and the flock meant it could not run beside the `dev`/writer
//! whose state it exists to serve, nor beside a second `serve`.
//!
//! This drives `indexer::serve_role` - the production entry point, not a hand-built `AppState` - over
//! both arms the issue asks for: no store on disk, and a store a live handle already holds.
