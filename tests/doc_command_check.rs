//! #769 - a documented command is a claim, and claims want a checker rather than a good memory
//! (`scripts/version-check.sh`'s line, generalised from version strings to commands and flags).
//!
//! `public/llms.txt` told coding agents to run `nuthatch roost` for five releases after the
//! subcommand was removed in 2.0. This walks every `nuthatch ...` invocation written in backticks
//! across the doc set and resolves it against clap's own command tree (`Cli::command()`, the same
//! ground truth `src/skill.rs::generate_cli_reference` renders from) - not a hand-kept list, which
//! would just be `CONFIG_SOURCES` again with the same failure mode.
//!
//! Scoped to commands and flags only, per the issue - not prose, not numbers (#767's problem).
//!
//! Deliberately anchored on backtick-formatted invocations, not bare mentions of the word
//! "nuthatch": these are what a reader copies and runs, the same reasoning `version-check.sh` gives
//! for anchoring on the container-tag lines rather than every version-shaped number in a file. A
//! flag is only checked when it appears inside such an invocation - the wider doc set (RFCs,
//! benchmarks, operator runbooks) mentions plenty of non-nuthatch `--flags` (docker, curl, grep,
//! cargo) that a blind whole-text scan would flag as fiction. `tests/skill_refs.rs` already runs
//! that blind scan, safely, because its scope is `skills/nuthatch-builder/*.md` alone - a skill
//! that is entirely about nuthatch usage. This file does not widen that one.
