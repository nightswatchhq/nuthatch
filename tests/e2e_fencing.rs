//! RFC-0022 slice 4: **single-owner, enforced rather than assumed**.
//!
//! §2 promises a cursor is owned by exactly one worker. A control-plane lease alone does not deliver
//! that - it makes it *likely*. The case a lease misses needs no partition and no bug:
//!
//! 1. worker A holds the lease and stalls - a long GC, a paused container, a host that went away;
//! 2. the lease expires and worker B claims the cursor, entirely legitimately;
//! 3. worker A wakes up. Nothing has told it anything happened. It finishes its window and writes.
//!
//! Two workers, one cursor, healthy network. The remedy is a monotonic fence enforced **by the
//! store**, because a worker that checks its own lease before writing is checking a fact that can
//! expire between the check and the write.
//!
//! These tests are the reason the fence lives in `HotStore` rather than in a scheduler: the guarantee
//! is only worth as much as the layer that refuses the write.
//!
//! ## Why these use one redb handle rather than two processes
//!
//! redb takes an **exclusive file lock**, so a second `Store::open` on the same file fails outright -
//! two redb writers are impossible by construction, which is exactly why embedded mode never needed a
//! fence. The scenario the fence exists for is a *shared* store, and there the rival worker is another
//! process against Postgres.
//!
//! So a rival is simulated the only honest way available here: by advancing the persisted fence, which
//! is precisely what another worker's `claim` does. The Postgres side of this is covered by
//! `pg_parity`, where two real connections exist.
