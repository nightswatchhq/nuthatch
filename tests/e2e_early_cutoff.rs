//! **Early cutoff on the serving path** (RFC-0033 §5, issue #364).
//!
//! A cosmetic edit - a comment in a view, a line of README - moves a nest's NID and leaves its *data*
//! identity alone. That is what `Manifest::data_identity` is for, and `migrate` has honoured it since
//! slice 5. The runtime never did: `MountTable::datasets` resolved `data/<nid>` straight out of the
//! mount record, and a freshly-installed edited nest resolved onto a directory holding its inputs and
//! no data at all. The nest then re-fetched the entire chain to rebuild bytes that were sitting one
//! directory away.
//!
//! **The discriminator is a provider that can no longer serve the history.** Asserting "it did not
//! re-index" against a tape that still holds every block is an absence assertion - the rows come out
//! identical either way, because a re-index reproduces them. So the second run gets a tape whose
//! blocks `1..=6` carry the same hashes and timestamps and **no logs**: the chain is still walkable,
//! the history is gone. Adoption is then the only route by which the edited nest can hold those rows,
//! and the assertion is a positive one.
