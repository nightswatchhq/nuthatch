//! RFC-0022 §Testing, **dynamic lifecycle**: "API add/remove a nest with no restart and no impact on
//! other nests' cursors."
//!
//! Drives the router directly with `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot` rather than binding a port - the
//! interesting behaviour is status codes and effects on desired state, and a real socket would add
//! flakiness without adding coverage.
