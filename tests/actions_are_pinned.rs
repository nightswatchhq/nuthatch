//! #829 - every third-party Action runs with this repository's credentials, so it must be pinned to
//! an immutable commit SHA rather than a tag anyone can move.
//!
//! The pinning itself was a morning's work. **This file is the part that matters**, because #913's
//! finding is that a gate written once and never exercised stops watching: a single unpinned `uses:`
//! added in six months' time restores the whole hazard, silently, and nothing else in the repo would
//! notice. A tag is not a version - it is a pointer, and the person who can move it is not
//! necessarily the person who published it.
//!
//! Deliberately a **shape** check rather than an allowlist of known-good SHAs. An allowlist is the
//! `CONFIG_SOURCES` failure mode that `doc_command_check.rs` and `analytics.rs` both call out: it
//! needs hand-editing on every legitimate bump, so it either blocks Dependabot or gets relaxed until
//! it means nothing. "Forty hex characters" needs no maintenance and cannot drift.
