//! #841 - the mutation gate's verdict step must fail when it has no verdict to give.
//!
//! `scripts/mutants-check.py` used to read an absent `mutants.out/missed.txt` as an empty survivor
//! list and print "No new survivors" on its way to exit 0. Every nightly mutation run between
//! 2026-08-23 and 2026-08-25 was cancelled at the job timeout and left exactly that state behind, so
//! the step that exists to report survivors reported success three times having read nothing.
//!
//! These tests are the control the script did not have: each one puts the checker in a state where
//! it cannot answer, and asserts it says so. The happy path is here too, because a check that only
//! ever fails is no better than one that only ever passes.
