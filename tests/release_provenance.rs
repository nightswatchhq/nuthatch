//! #830 - a checksum downloaded from the same release as the binary it describes establishes nothing
//! about *who built the binary*.
//!
//! Anyone able to replace a tarball can replace its `.sha256` in the same breath, and a compromised
//! release credential or a retagged Action (#829) leaves the pair perfectly consistent. Build
//! provenance attestations answer the question the sidecar cannot - which repository, which commit,
//! which workflow run - and they are signed by GitHub's OIDC identity rather than by a key we would
//! have to hold and rotate.
//!
//! This file exists because #913's finding is that gates stop watching. Specifically, the failure mode
//! here is a **new artifact added to the release and never attested**: the workflow would go green, the
//! release would publish, and one of its binaries would silently carry no provenance at all. So the set
//! of attested subjects is not a hand-kept list - it is derived from the workflow's own `files:` blocks
//! and required to cover them, the same parser-derived discipline `src/analytics.rs` settled on after
//! four hand-kept denylists in a row came up short.
