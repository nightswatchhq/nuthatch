//! RFC-0041 §5.2, end to end: an authored incremental entity survives a reorg.
//!
//! **Why this is not a unit test.** `entity_view`'s own property test feeds both the `+1` and the
//! `-1` side from the same source, and passes. The real paths do not agree by construction: an
//! insertion is a `DecodedRow` straight from the registry, while a retraction is reconstructed from
//! the hot store's JSON. DBSP cancels by key, so if those two produce different rows nothing
//! cancels - the entity keeps the fact that was rolled back *and* gains a row at weight `-1` that
//! nothing will ever cancel again.
//!
//! That divergence is invisible to any test that builds both sides itself. It is only visible here,
//! through `spawn_nest`, `entities_in_range` and a real fork.
