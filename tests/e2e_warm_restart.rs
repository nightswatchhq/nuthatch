//! Warm-restart rebuild, end to end (issue #150).
//!
//! Derived views are not persisted - on restart they are rebuilt from a **cold fold** over sealed
//! segments plus a **hot replay** of everything above the sealed watermark. Get the boundary wrong in
//! either direction and the result is silently incorrect rather than loudly broken:
//!
//! - fold a segment that the hot store still holds → every row in it counts **twice**;
//! - skip a range that was sealed and pruned → those rows vanish from the view.
//!
//! `analytics::cold_fold_respects_the_sealed_through_watermark` covers the first at unit level against
//! a hand-built segment. This is the fuller version the audit asked for: run a real nest, really seal
//! and prune, drop it, respawn it on the same directory, and assert the rebuilt balances are identical
//! to a nest that indexed the same chain from scratch. Only the whole pipeline can catch a boundary
//! that is off by one segment.
