//! #845 - the drift check must refuse to report success when it has compared nothing.
//!
//! `scripts/check-required-contexts.sh` is the only thing that compares `.github/required-checks.txt`
//! against the protection GitHub actually enforces. Before this it was invoked by no workflow, no
//! test and no documented command - and would have exited 0 without a token anyway, so wiring it up
//! carelessly would have produced a permanently green step that read nothing.
//!
//! The script derives its repo root from its own location, so each test builds a throwaway root with
//! its own `scripts/` and `.github/` and runs the real script inside it. No network: every case here
//! is one the script must decide before it would reach the API.
