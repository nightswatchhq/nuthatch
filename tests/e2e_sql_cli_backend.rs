//! Which backend `nuthatch sql` picks, driven through the real binary (issue #413).
//!
//! The decision lives in `SqlBackend::open` in `src/main.rs`, so there is no library seam to unit-test
//! it through - these run the compiled `nuthatch` and watch a stand-in for `nuthatch dev` to see
//! whether the fallback fired. That is the point of the issue: the probe used to open the store with
//! `Database::create`, so in a directory with no nest it *made* one, reported a local nest, answered
//! from the empty file it had just written, and never asked the running instance that held the data.
//!
//! All three routings are asserted together, because "absent → HTTP" alone is satisfied by a backend
//! that always chooses HTTP.
//!
//! The mount-prefix tests below (issue #546, closing the gap #509/#545 left) are a separate concern
//! from the backend-choice tests above: given the HTTP fallback is chosen, does it ask for the right
//! path? They cannot reuse `serving_instance()` - that stand-in answers `/sql` unconditionally, which
//! would go green whether or not `resolve_mount_prefix` worked. They bring up the real
//! `serve::compose_runtime` wiring `runtime::dev` uses instead, exactly to avoid the fixture this repo
//! keeps getting wrong: an `AppState` built by hand and served without ever going through the router
//! that actually nests a mount under `/<alias>`.
