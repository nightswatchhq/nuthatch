//! `--cors` is almost entirely wiring, so this tests the wiring (#1318).
//!
//! The unit tests in `serve.rs` apply the layer themselves and then assert on the response, which
//! proves [`nuthatch::serve::cors_layer`] builds a correct layer and proves nothing about whether
//! anything ever *uses* it. That is the same shape as the three fixtures which proved a handler and
//! never the composition, so the one assertion that matters here goes through
//! [`nuthatch::serve::bind_and_serve`] over a real socket, which is the single place every serving
//! path - solo `dev`, `serve`, the two-version endpoint, and a mounts runtime - actually binds.
