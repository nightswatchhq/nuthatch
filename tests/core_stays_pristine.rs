//! RFC-0053's compatibility surface is an optional lane. The delightful core (RFC-0015) is not.
//!
//! Chief, 2026-09-11: *"nuthatch's default and golden path should remain the delightful core that
//! remains perfect and pristine"*, and *"graphql is just an optional serving lane"*. Both are true of
//! the tree today. This file is what makes them stay true, on the pattern `payment_absent.rs`
//! established for RFC-0046 §1: a boundary nobody can cross by accident is a gate, not a paragraph.
//!
//! The golden path is `init 0xAddr` -> `dev` -> `/entities`, `/entity/{id}`, `/sql`. Four properties
//! hold it apart from the Graph dialect, and each one here can fail:
//!
//! 1. `init` writes no Graph artefact, on either of its paths, so a scaffolded nest has nothing to
//!    serve the lane from.
//! 2. `graph/schema.graphql` is read at exactly one production site - inside the request handler - so
//!    no startup path can come to depend on it.
//! 3. The Graph dialect is not configurable. No flag on `dev` or `serve` switches it on or off,
//!    because the artefact is the opt-in and a second gate is a second thing to get wrong.
//! 4. The data is the same underneath. The lane compiles to SQL and goes through the same
//!    `run_sql_query` that `/sql` uses, over the same views: no second store, no GraphQL-shaped table
//!    and no write path. RFC-0053's own words - a compiler over stored state, not a second indexer.
//!
//! The serving half - every golden-path endpoint answering on a nest with no Graph schema, and the
//! Graph routes answering a named refusal rather than an empty success - lives next to the router it
//! has to bind, as `serve::tests::the_core_serves_with_no_graph_schema_present`.
