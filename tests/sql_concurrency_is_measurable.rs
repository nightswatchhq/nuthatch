//! #1006 - the permit count is a memory bound nobody chose as one, and it could not be measured.
//!
//! `SQL_MAX_CONCURRENCY` is a `const usize = 2`. Measuring the throughput/RSS curve at 1/2/4/8/16
//! permits - which #1006 asks for, on the box that enforces the per-cursor RAM budget - therefore
//! needed **five separate builds**. That is how a ceiling ends up being set from whichever box was
//! convenient, which this project has done before.
//!
//! `NUTHATCH_SQL_MAX_CONCURRENCY` makes it one binary and five settings. It is deliberately capped:
//! concurrent queries do **not** serialise (RFC-0042 §14 corrected that), but each one that misses
//! the connection cache opens its own DuckDB, and unbounded at 32 clients reached **1,313 MB - 64%
//! of one cursor's entire 2 GB**, shared across every nest on that cursor.
