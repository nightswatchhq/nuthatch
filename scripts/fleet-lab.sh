#   ./scripts/fleet-lab.sh up multi     # three boxes + a private network
#
#   ./scripts/fleet-lab.sh verify       # `multi` genuinely distributes: control plane + store + FE on
#                                       # one box, writers on their own, talking over the private net
#   ./scripts/fleet-lab.sh partition    # cut a writer off the control-plane API, assert it keeps indexing
#   ./scripts/fleet-lab.sh skew         # push a writer clock forward, assert the lease does not move
#   ./scripts/fleet-lab.sh pull         # delete a writer's nest, assert it pulls one from the registry
#   ./scripts/fleet-lab.sh down         # destroy everything this script created
#
# Until 2026-07-31 `multi` provisioned three boxes and then ran the whole compose fleet on the first,
# leaving the other two idle - so `partition` and `skew` were firewalling and clock-skewing machines
# that ran nothing, and passed. Fixed; the warning that used to live here is gone because the defect is.
#
# ## This spends money
#
# Hetzner bills **hourly**, which is what makes this cheap: a single box is ~€0.01/hr and three are
# ~€0.03/hr, so a day of verification is small change. It is only cheap if you destroy it, so `down`
# is a first-class verb, every resource is tagged, and `up` prints the running cost before creating
# anything.
#
# ## Why cloud-init rather than a pile of ssh commands
#
# The box configures itself from a declarative file you can read before it runs. That is the difference
# between a lab someone else can trust and a sequence of steps they have to take on faith - and this
# script exists partly so GraphOps can read it rather than be told what we did.

#   1. `partition` blocked the whole control-plane HOST. In the `multi` shape Postgres runs on that
#      same box, so it cut the writer off from its **hot store** as well - and a writer that cannot
#      reach its store cannot index at all. The stated expectation ("the cursor it holds STILL
#      INDEXING") was therefore impossible to satisfy. It now blocks **only the control-plane API
#      port**, leaving 5432 reachable, which is the invariant we actually care about: the control
#      plane schedules, the store serves, and losing the former must not stop ingestion.
#
#   2. Both drafts polled the writer's `/metrics`. `worker` serves no HTTP at all and publishes no
#      port. Progress is instead read from the **shared Postgres**, which is a better signal anyway:
#      it proves the write landed in the store rather than that a process incremented a counter.

  # exit with no output at all. Diagnosing that cost more than the fix.

#
# `PgStore` creates a schema per nest *and* per cursor, so several carry a `meta` table: a nest's own
# schema records things like `block_timestamps`, while the cursor's records the lease and `last_block`.
# Picking the first `meta` alphabetically found `nest_lab` and reported "no lease to observe" while a
# lease was sitting in `nest_cursor_arbitrum_one`. Prefer a schema that has lease or progress rows,
# and fall back to any `meta` so the error message stays about the missing data rather than the query.

# machine that ends up holding the cursor may have nothing on disk. That was true of nuthatch until
# now - `desired_nest` recorded a `version` and a `bundle_hash` that nothing on the worker side read.

# So this deletes the nest from the writer box entirely, publishes it to a registry only the control
# box serves, pins it, and asserts the writer indexes anyway. Deleting is the point: a check that
# leaves the nest in place would pass whether or not the pull works.
