# RFC-0063 gates for slices 3 and 4: run real address-history nests and compare their /api answers
# with pinned Etherscan answers.
#
#   NUTHATCH_RPC=<url> NUTHATCH_TRACE_RPC=<url> scripts/rfc0063-gate.sh <nuthatch-binary> <fixtures-dir>
#
# NUTHATCH_RPC serves logs, transactions, receipts and nonces; NUTHATCH_TRACE_RPC serves
# trace_filter and trace_transaction (it may be the same endpoint). Both carry keys, so they reach
# the nest through its environment, never its arguments, and every line printed here masks them.
#
# <fixtures-dir> holds Etherscan's answers for vitalik.eth over blocks 18,000,000-20,000,000, one
# JSON row per line (vitalik-txlist.jsonl, vitalik-tokentx.jsonl, vitalik-tokennfttx.jsonl,
# vitalik-token1155tx.jsonl, vitalik-txlistinternal.jsonl); re-pin them with Etherscan's account API
# over the same range. The internal-transaction cases are committed in tests/fixtures/rfc0063 and
# re-pinned by scripts/rfc0063-pin.sh.
#
# Phases: (1) vitalik's history, every hash set and the fields rotki reads; (2) each of vitalik's
# internal transactions by txhash; (3) one single-block nest per case in cases.tsv; (4) the beacon
# withdrawals of 0x7a25bd5f286fb722e7578c62e86a675ff0a00b15 over 17,034,870-17,300,000, a body per
# block, so the slow one (<fixtures-dir>/withdrawals-0x7a25-txsBeaconWithdrawal.jsonl); (5) one
# nest per getminedblocks case in mined.tsv; (6) one nest per txlist case in created.tsv, contracts
# deployed by a transaction, whose txlist opens with it; (7) the block partitions of slice 2: one
# rebuilt byte for byte, a mirror missing one, and pre-London getblocknobytime. PHASES picks any of
# 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 (2 runs within 1); (8) produced blocks and MEV-Boost deliveries per mev.tsv.
#
# MIRROR=<dir> runs phases 4 and 5 through partitions `nuthatch partitions` built into <dir> for their
# ranges (17030000-17309999, 20000000-20009999, 14000000-14009999, 15340000-15349999) and phase 7
# also needs 12000000-12009999: parity as before, plus no body scan, rewards hydrated only for
# produced blocks, pagination, the partition cache within budget and getblocknobytime.
# MIRROR_DIR overrides MIRROR for one nest.
# Exits non-zero on any mismatch, after listing every one.
