# Apply `.github/required-checks.txt` to a protected branch's required status checks (#1094).
#
# The committed list is the source of truth; this is how it reaches GitHub. Before this existed the
# only way to change the enforced set was a hand-typed `gh api` call, which left the repository
# unable to say what it had asked for - the gap Jules named on #1094: "keep the settings change as
# an auditable deployment artifact".
#
# Deliberately a PATCH of `required_status_checks` alone, not the PUT that `protect-branch.sh` does.
# That script copies a whole protection object onto a *new* sprint branch, where there is nothing to
# preserve. Run against `main` it would also write `strict` and `enforce_admins`, silently changing
# settings the caller never mentioned. Narrow endpoint, narrow blast radius.
#
#   scripts/apply-required-contexts.sh                  # dry run against main, prints the diff
#   scripts/apply-required-contexts.sh --apply          # writes it
#   scripts/apply-required-contexts.sh --apply --branch sprint/foo
#
# Needs a token with admin write on the repo. `GITHUB_TOKEN` in Actions cannot do this (#909), the
# same reason `check-required-contexts.sh` needs `PROTECTION_READ_TOKEN` to read (#1095).
