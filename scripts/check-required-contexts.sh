# Compare `.github/required-checks.txt` to the live protection API on `main` (#715).
#
# ## Why this refuses to run blind (#845)
#
# It used to answer a missing token by printing a count and **exiting 0**. That is the same shape as
# the mutation checker in #841: the comparison is the entire point of the script, and its degraded
# mode was indistinguishable from success except by reading stdout. Wired into a workflow without a
# token deliberately granted, it would have produced a permanently green step that compared nothing.
#
# So: no token is a **failure**, and `--offline` is how a caller says it knows and wants the
# file-only check anyway. "I could not compare" must never render as "they match".
#
# The token needs read access to branch protection, and **`GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be given it at all**
# (#909). `administration` is an App/PAT scope; it is not a key the workflow `permissions:` block
# accepts, and a file that names it is rejected at validation, so the workflow never starts. This
# comment used to say the opposite, and so did the FAIL text below - which meant the recovery path
# offered to a reader at the moment they needed it could not be taken. A failure message naming an
# impossible fix is worse than one that says nothing.
#
# The reachable path is a PAT or App token with repo admin read, held as the repository secret
# `PROTECTION_READ_TOKEN` and passed in as `GH_TOKEN`.

# **Byte semantics, not the runner's locale.** Every context in `.github/required-checks.txt` contains
# `·` (U+00B7, the bytes C2 B7), and `grep`/`sort` change behaviour on non-ASCII input depending on
# `LC_*`: GNU grep can decline to match a line it considers an encoding error, and `sort` refuses an
# illegal byte sequence outright. A CI runner whose locale differs from a developer's would then read
# a healthy file as one missing a context - which is the shape of the #1119 failure, where `main`
# reported `required-checks.txt is missing 'Jules approval'` against a file that plainly contains it.
#
# Pinning to C makes the comparison byte-wise and identical everywhere. The contexts are compared for
# exact equality, so collation order is irrelevant to the result.

FAIL: no GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN, so live branch protection was not read.

This is a failure and not a pass. The whole job of this script is to compare the committed list
against what GitHub actually enforces; without a token it has compared nothing, and reporting
success would mean "the check that watches the checks" is itself scenery.

  - Locally:     GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) scripts/check-required-contexts.sh
  - In Actions:  set the repository secret PROTECTION_READ_TOKEN to a PAT (or App token) with
                 admin read on this repo, and pass it as GH_TOKEN. GITHUB_TOKEN cannot do this
                 job: reading branches/main/protection is an admin-scoped read, and there is no
                 `permissions:` key that grants it (#909 - naming `administration` there is not
                 merely useless, it invalidates the workflow file and stops it running at all).
  - Deliberately without a token: pass --offline, which checks the file alone and says so.
