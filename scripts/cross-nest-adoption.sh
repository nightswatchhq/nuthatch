# The executable half of docs/verification.md's cross-nest adoption step (GH #569).
#
# Proves `runtime::adoptable` (src/runtime.rs) across two *independently authored* nests - not two
# mounts of the same nest, which share a NID and were never the interesting case (RFC-0033 §5 / #569).
#
# Nest A and nest B declare the same contract, ABI and start block (so their `data_identity()`
# matches) but are authored separately - different alias, different `semantic.toml` description,
# different `views/` - so their NIDs differ. A indexes and seals against a real JSON-RPC endpoint
# (scripts/fixture_rpc.py); B is then migrated in against an endpoint that has been switched to serve
# the exact same block headers with **zero logs** - a provider that could not have served the range B
# ends up holding. If B's row counts match A's, the only route was adoption.
#
