# release-gate-run.sh - the ThinkPad's side of the release gate (#1749): fetch a release
# candidate's Linux binary, run scripts/release-gate.sh against a production nest's copy, and
# report the verdict on the candidate's commit as a status. See docs/release-gate.md.
#
#   scripts/release-gate-run.sh <tag>                     gate a published release or candidate
#   scripts/release-gate-run.sh --poll                    gate the newest ungated release that is
#                                                         newer than production; none, exit 0 quietly
#   scripts/release-gate-run.sh --binary PATH --sha SHA   gate a local build of commit SHA
#   options: --production <tag>  the version production runs, measured as the baseline (default:
#                                the version the copy's PROVENANCE records, read after the refresh;
#                                with no PROVENANCE, the latest full release that is not the candidate)
#            --no-status         run and print, post nothing
#
# The candidate is compared with the production version measured on the same box, the same copy
# and the same day, so neither a refreshed copy nor a different machine reads as a regression.
# Production over its own budget, or failing statements itself, is still the baseline: the
# candidate is judged on its own refusals, regressions, differing answers and peak.
# The status never blocks the tag: the tag exists before the gate runs, and the context is not a
# required check anywhere. A red status stops the roll (deploy-nest.sh), not the release.
#
# Every production nest (#1794): GATE_NESTS names a config file with one nest per line, and each is
# gated in turn by this script run for that nest alone, posting its own status,
# release-gate/<name>. The exit is the worst of theirs. See deploy/release-gate/nests.conf.example.
#   <name> <copy> <query set> <env file> <refresh: helsinki | local | none>
#
# Environment:
#   GATE_NESTS    the nests' config file; unset means the one nest the variables below describe
#   GATE_STATE    working directory: binaries and run logs             (default ~/release-gate)
#   GATE_NEST     the allocations nest copy, segments plus redb        (default $GATE_STATE/alloc-nest)
#   GATE_NAME     the nest's name, as in its status context            (default alloc-nest)
#   GATE_SET      the query set, required for one nest: kittiwake's nuthatch-gate/alloc-queries.tsv
#                 (private); with GATE_NESTS each nest's set comes from the config
#   GATE_ENV      production's environment for the nest, read from its unit (release-gate.sh --env);
#                 unset means release-gate.sh's PROD_ENV, the allocations nest's
#   GATE_REFRESH  a command run before the gate to refresh GATE_NEST, e.g. the rsync from Helsinki;
#                 unset means the copy is used as it stands
#   GATE_REFRESH_SCRIPT  what a config's helsinki and local refreshes run
#                        (default deploy/release-gate/refresh-from-helsinki.sh beside this)
#   GATE_REPO     (default nuthatch-org/nuthatch)
#   GATE_TARGET   release asset target         (default x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
#   GATE_PASSES   passes per binary            (default 3)
#   GATE_CONCURRENCY  statements in flight at once (default 2, as 8107's SQL_MAX_CONCURRENCY); a
#                     GATE_ENV that sets NUTHATCH_SQL_MAX_CONCURRENCY decides it instead
