# Sourced by release-gate.sh and release-gate-run.sh: one gate run at a time per nest copy. Two runs
# against one copy contend for its redb lock, and the second `serve` will not start.
#
# gate_lock <nest-copy-dir> takes the copy's lock, waiting for whoever holds it, and keeps it until
# the shell exits (call gate_unlock from the EXIT trap). It exports GATE_LOCK_HELD, so a child gate
# run on the same copy, as release-gate-run.sh starts, rides on its parent's lock instead of waiting
# on it for ever. flock where there is one; elsewhere (macOS) a mkdir lock that records its pid and
# is broken once that pid has gone, since nothing releases it for a killed holder.
