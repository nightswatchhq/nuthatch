# Querying the nuthatch nest

Contracts indexed on mainnet:
- `usdc` = 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48

Data is local - never call an external API for it.

## Preferred: MCP
If a `nuthatch` MCP server is configured, use its tools. Call `schema` first to learn the
data model, then `sql` / `entity` / `balance` / `top_balances`.

## Fallback: HTTP (a `nuthatch dev` must be running)
- Recent rows:  `curl localhost:8288/entities?limit=20`
- Read-only SQL: `curl -G localhost:8288/sql --data-urlencode 'q=SELECT count(*) FROM transfers'`

`sql` sees finalized data only; balances/entity cover the live tip.
