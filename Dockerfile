# The published container image (ghcr.io/nightswatchhq/nuthatch).
#
# It copies the **same** release binary that is attached to the GitHub Release rather than rebuilding
# from source, so the image and the tarball are byte-identical. A separate build would be a second
# artifact nobody diffed, and "the image behaves differently from the binary" is a miserable thing to
# debug at 3am.
#
# Deliberately not a builder-stage image: a from-source build here would recompile duckdb and dbsp on
# every tag for no benefit, and would make the image's provenance harder to state, not easier.
