# Swaps a production nest on Helsinki onto a re-index staged beside it, and back: the directory swap
# of deploy/swap-allocations-nest-l1.sh (#1882) with the units, directories, ports and the nest's own
# invariant read from a config file (deploy/swaps/<name>.conf).
#
#   deploy/swap-nest-dir.sh <conf> check               the prechecks alone; nothing stops
#   deploy/swap-nest-dir.sh <conf> swap
#   deploy/swap-nest-dir.sh <conf> rollback <stamp>    <stamp> is what `swap` printed
#
# No unit file is edited. `swap` stops both units, moves the production directory to
# <dir>.<OLD_SUFFIX>-<stamp> and the staged one into its place, and starts production on its own
# unit: every path, port, flag, drop-in and publish target stays as it was. Downtime is one stop and
# start of the production port.
#
# Everything the swap reads is checked before anything stops: both units active, both directories on
# one filesystem, the same binary, the staged nest within MAX_GAP blocks of production with no failed
# views, the INVARIANT answered as INVARIANT_WANT on the staged port and not on production's (so the
# two can be told apart afterwards, since a re-index of one definition keeps its NID), and the smoke.
# After the start it requires /ready, the staged NID, the invariant and the smoke on the production
# port; any failure puts the old directory back, starts it, and checks it came back. The box side
# runs as a transient systemd unit, so a dropped ssh cannot leave it half done.
#
# Config (sourced; see deploy/swaps/data-services-nest-fresh.conf):
#   PROD_UNIT STAGED_UNIT  the systemd units
#   PROD_DIR STAGED_DIR    their --dir, under one filesystem
#   PROD_PORT STAGED_PORT  their --listen ports on 127.0.0.1
#   OLD_SUFFIX             the old directory becomes $PROD_DIR.$OLD_SUFFIX-<stamp>
#   SMOKE                  the unit's smoke file, one statement per line (private kittiwake repo)
#   INVARIANT INVARIANT_WANT  one /sql statement whose one-column, one-row answer is INVARIANT_WANT
#                          on the re-index and something else on the directory it replaces
#   MAX_GAP                blocks the staged nest may be from production (default 2000)
#   SWAP_HOST SWAP_KEY     the box (default root@89.167.109.4, ~/.ssh/hetzner_drpc)
